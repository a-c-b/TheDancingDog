# The Dancing Dog business plan
### Author:  Andrea Brice
#### Co. Name:  Cherry Picking Enterprises

This repository contains the documentation of the business plan created for the owners of The Dancing Dog, a craft beer bar with quick serve food which was to be developed in Seattle, Washington.  

The process of creating the business plan originated with a feasibility study and forecast creation to see if the efforts would be warranted.   While the final product (minus financials) is located [here.](Business Plan - no financials.pdf), other supporting documents will be made available for demonstration purposes of visualization, analysis, and documentation skills.

1.  [Building The Dancing Dog Pricing Structure and Product Selection](PricingStructure.md)
2.  [Presentation of the Market Analaysis](Market Analysis for The Dancing Dog.pptx)  You will need to download the file.  There is automation and slide transitioning. If you want you can view it on the web [here, at Office Mix,](https://mix.office.com/watch/1di1l1pl8zlbr) but you'll end up having to hit "Next" alot.  The transitions and animation don't appear to reliably work.
3.  The [Excel summary of the Market Analysis data is here](demographics for business plan.xlsx).  Of course, the exploratory workbook was very ugly, so this is a cleaned up copy from which the PowerPoint and the 3D movie tour was made.  
4.  [Here is the 3D movie tour](3D Tour of Real Estate Scores.mp4) of some of the demographic data combined with the geolocation information.  It is an .mp4 file.
5.  [Here is the Final Five selection along with the final criteria list.](DD FinalFive.mp4)  It too is .mp4.
