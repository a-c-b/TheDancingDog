## Author:  Andrea Brice

This repository contains the documentation of the business plan of The Dancing Dog, a craft beer bar with quick serve food which was to be developed in Seattle, Washington.  

The process of creating the business plan originated with a feasibility study and forecast creation to see if the efforts would be warranted.   While the final product (minus financials) is located [here.](Business Plan - no financials.pdf), other supporting documents will be made available for demonstration purposes of visualization, analysis, and documentation skills.

1.  [Building The Dancing Dog Pricing Structure and Product Selection](PricingStructure.html)
2.  [Presentation of the Market Analaysis](Market Analysis for The Dancing Dog.pptx)  You will need to download the file into PowerPoint for the automation to work.
3.  The [Excel summary of the Market Analysis data is here](demographics for business plan.xlsx).  Of course, the exploratory workbook was very ugly, so this is a cleaned up copy from which the PowerPoint and the 3D movie tour was made.  
4.  [Here is the 3D movie tour](3D Tour of Real Estate Scores.mp4) of some of the demographic data combined with the geolocation information.  It is an mp4 file.
